	<p>Born from sheer frustration with society, and an overwhelming desire to retreat back in time, The <em>describe someone</em> project has arrived. Through observation, self reflection, and intuition, author <a href="http://beatroute.ca/?s=kristie+sparksman">Kristie Sparksman</a> has spent countless hours obsessing over why people are so afraid. From crash and burning scorns, to finding the love of her life, she is determined to reteach the art of using face to face interaction to feel connection once more. In order to understand what has happened with relationships and technology, we must first determine: <ul><li>when staring at a screen became more important than staring at a face</li>
	<li>why social media has given us 'too many options'</li>
	<li>when we inherited <a href="https://socialanxietyinstitute.org/what-is-social-anxiety">social anxieties</li></a>
	<li>the cause of people feeling as if something better will come along</li>

	</ul></p>
